# rock-paper-scissors
The goal of this project was to create a rock paper scissors game without website graphic design. The most important thing was practicing javascript and planning the project with pseudocode.

Self-evaluation: At first, I stayed very focused on the project planning and the coding went without any major problems. Instead, in the last step, where the game function itself was created, I started having some problems and forgot to use pseudocode. However, I managed to solve the problems, although I could have saved time by planning. There is still a lot to improve in the pseudocode and javascript code, but for the first project it went quite well.
